## 3x3 Dimensioned Matrix Transpose Creator

### Works with given 9 numbers and outputs the transposed matrix to the user.
#### Comment lines below are the additional (long version) of this code, works if;
    - System.out.print(userMatrix[j][i] + " "); // row 23
#### Changed to;
    -System.out.print(userMatrix[i][j] + " ");
#### and after that changing the comment lines to codes from row #29 to #54
